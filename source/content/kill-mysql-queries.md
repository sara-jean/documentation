Long-running MySQL queries keep other transactions from accessing the necessary tables to execute a request, leaving your users on hold. To kill these queries, you'll need to [access the environment's MySQL Database](/mysql-access).

## Identify Long-Running Queries

After successfully creating a local MySQL connection to the site's database, run the following command to show a list of active threads:

```sql
mysql> show processlist;
```

Review the `Time` field to identify the longest running query and run the following command to kill it. In the example below, replace `<thread_id>` with the ID of the query you want to terminate:

```sql
mysql> kill <thread_id>;
```

## Kill All Queries

If a large number of bad requests are blocking valid queries, you can clear them out without having to run `kill` on every individual thread.

Execute the following to generate `kill` commands from the `PROCESSLIST` table:

```sql
mysql> SELECT GROUP_CONCAT(CONCAT('KILL ',id,';') SEPARATOR ' ') 'Paste the following query to kill all processes' FROM information_schema.processlist WHERE user<>'system user'\G
```

Copy the provided query in the output and run as instructed.
