The `hosts` file exists on all major operating systems. It's a list of IP addresses and domains that takes precedence over DNS assigned values. You can modify your `hosts` file to test domain-specific settings leading up to a migration, before DNS records have been updated.

<Partial file="_hosts-file.md" />

To get the IP address of your Pantheon environment to use in your hosts file. You can use dig. Replace `dev-example.pantheonsite.io` with your site's domain:

```bash{outputLines:2}
dig +short dev-example.pantheonsite.io
203.0.113.42
```
